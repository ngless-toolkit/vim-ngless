# Vim plugin for editing ngless files

Currently adds syntax highlighting for
[NGLess](https://ngless.embl.de)

This is compatible with [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) (and
similar plugin managers), so you should be able to just add the following line
to your '.vimrc' file:

    Plugin 'ngless-toolkit/vim-ngless'

This is also compatible with [neovim](https://neovim.io/).
